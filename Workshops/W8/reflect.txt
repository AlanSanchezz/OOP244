During this workshop, I gained a deeper understanding of virtual functions, abstract base classes, and how dynamic polymorphism works in C++. I learned how to use pure virtual functions to enforce implementation in derived classes and how abstract classes like Shape and LblShape help structure code in a flexible and reusable way. Implementing the Line and Rectangle classes allowed me to practice inheritance, function overriding, and proper use of dynamic memory, especially with character pointers.

One of the main difficulties I faced was debugging layout issues in the output, particularly matching exact spacing required by the tester. Another challenge was managing label alignment and ensuring memory was correctly handled without leaks.

As feedback, I would suggest that more clarification be provided on formatting expectations in advance—perhaps through a visual output example—so students can avoid unnecessary frustration due to minor output mismatches. Overall, the workshop was very helpful for reinforcing OOP fundamentals.
