In this workshop, I practiced using function templates in C++ to make my code more flexible and reusable. I created the dynaCopy functions to handle dynamic memory allocation for arrays of any type, whether theyâ€™re primitive types like int or custom types like my Name class. I also made sure to manage memory properly by deleting existing data before allocating new memory. One thing that stood out to me was how useful templates are when you want to avoid repeating code for different types. The prnArray function was a good example of this, since it works for anything that supports <<. Overall, this workshop helped me understand templates better and reminded me how important it is to handle memory correctly when working with dynamic arrays. I feel more confident now writing generic functions and making my code cleaner and more adaptable.
