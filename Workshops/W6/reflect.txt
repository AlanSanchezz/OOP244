In this workshop, I practiced working with dynamic memory and the Rule of Three in C++. At first, I found the idea of the copy constructor and copy assignment confusing, especially understanding why shallow copies could cause memory leaks. After reviewing the examples and testing my implementation, I see why properly allocating and releasing memory is so important when a class uses raw pointers. Another key part was overloading the << and >> operators. Making these helpers work with both cin and ifstream helped me see how flexible operator overloading can be. I also learned the importance of separating implementation files and keeping the instructorâ€™s test files unchanged. Debugging linker errors taught me to check that all declared functions actually have definitions in my source file. Overall, I feel more confident handling classes with resources, and I understand better how C++ manages file streams and dynamic arrays.
